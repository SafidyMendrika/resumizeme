# Resumizeme

Resumizeme is a personal project designed to test my skills in **React** and **Next.js**. The project is inspired by the real website [resumiezme.io](https://resumiezme.io) and replicates its proportions and typography based on the Figma design.

## Features

- 🔍 **Search above past searches**
- ➕ **Add a new board**
- ✏ **Rename a board by double-clicking it**
- 📝 **Change personal information**
- 💾 **Save personal information in localStorage**

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (React Framework)
- **TypeScript** (for type safety)
- **pure CSS/Styled Components** (for styling)
- **LocalStorage** (for saving data locally)

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SafidyMendrika/resumizeme.git
   cd resumizeme
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Notes

- The project is optimized for **client-side rendering** to handle localStorage operations without SSR errors.
- The **board management system** allows users to add, rename, and organize boards dynamically.
